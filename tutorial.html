        <h2>Origin</h2>

                    Taroky originated in the Czech Republic as a Type III <a href="https://www.pagat.com/tarot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="small-link">Tarot card game</a>.
                    It is important to note the distinction between Tarot card games and the occult Tarot cards. The original card games have historical roots as far back as 1456, whereas occult Tarot cards did not exist until the late eighteenth century.
                    Taroky predates Tarot cards and is associated with it only in name and has nothing to do with the occult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Type III Tarot Card game, Taroky consists of a 54 card deck which contains the 4 French suits (Spades, Clubs, Hearts, and Diamonds) along with 21 Trump cards (known as Taroks) and the Fool card, known as the Skyz, which is the highest trump/Tarok.
                    Each of the four French suits consists of the Court (A King, Queen, Rider, and Jack) along with 4 standard cards (for the black suits, these are 7, 8, 9, and 10, whereas the red suits are ace, 2, 3, and 4).
                    Each card has an associated point value which is standard across all Type II and Type III Tarot Card games.

                <p>5 Points: Kings, Skyz, XXI (Mond), and I (Pagat)</p>
                <p>4 Points: Queens</p>
                <p>3 Points: Riders</p>
                <p>2 Points: Jacks / Kluks</p>
                <p>1 Point: Everything else (other Trumps and colors)</p>

        <h2>The Game</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>
                    Taroky is a turn-based point-trick game. The goal of Taroky is to earn as many chips as possible throughout a game. Each game contains several rounds, and usually lasts for an hour of playtime.
                    Within each round, there are three main phases:
                </p>
                <p>The Setup Phase, where the cards are shuffled and dealt out, Povinnost determined, Prever and money cards are called, Valat, Contra, and Pagat on the End are determined</p>
                <p>The Play Phase, which consists of twelve consecutive tricks</p>
                <p>The Cleanup Phase, where points are counted and chips are paid</p>
                <p>
                    During each round, the goal is to earn chips through winning points during each trick.
                    Chips can only be earned through money cards, penalty payouts, and winning the round.
                    The game starts with a player shuffling the cards, the cut, and the deal
                </p>
                <h3>The Deal</h3>
                <p>
                    In an ordinary game, the deck usually goes to the most senior player at the table.
                    In MachTarok, however, the deck instead defaults to the first player to join the room, called the room host
                    Some players prefer to cut the deck and each choose a card, where the highest valued card decides the first player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regardless, the chosen player shuffles the deck and passes the deck clockwise to be cut.
                    In most cases, the deck is then cut and passed back to the original player. However, when the cutting player feels that the deck has not been shuffled properly or, as is usually the case, is on a losing streak,
                    the cutting player may decide from several various other choices. This is called "Knocking the deck" or simply a "knock", since the cutting player knocks on the deck and passes it back without cutting it.
                    The cutting player may then choose from among these options:
                </p>
                <!-- TODO Change to an unordered list. I forgot how lol -->
                <p>Deal by ones - normally chosen to incur a misdeal penalty, as it is the most difficult way to deal</p>
                <p>Deal by twos</p>
                <p>Deal by threes</p>
                <p>Deal by fours</p>
                <p>Deal by sixes - which is essentially just skipping the cut</p>
                <p>Deal by twelves straight</p>
                <p>Deal by 3, 4, 5</p>
                <p>Deal by twelves choice</p>
                <p>
                    No matter the choice, the dealer then takes the top six cards of the deck, in order, and places them in the center of the bord.
                    This is known as the Talon, and will be important later.
                    The dealer then moves counter-clockwise around the board, so that the dealer is the last player to receive cards, dealing either six or the chosen number of cards to each player. No matter the case, each player will end up with twelve cards in hand.
                    In the case of twelves choice, the dealer places the remaining cards in piles of twelve and players choose which pile to receive in the same order they would have been dealt to, with the dealer receiving the last pile.
                </p>
                <h3> Povinnost and Prever</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the cards are dealt, Povinnost (which means "Authority") is determined. Povinnost is the lead player of the round, and has several special characteristics which are important later.
                    For the first round in each game, Povinnost is the player who was dealt the II. In the event the II was dealt to the Talon, the player with the III is instead Povinnost, on up until VIII, which is the highest possible.
                    Each round after the first, Povinnost instead rotates counter-clockwise, such that Povinnost will be the dealer for the next round, then will cut the round after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first action made each game is declaring Povinnost and Prever
