The game begins when the host player presses 'Start Game'

The server randomizes the deck of cards and chooses which player will start as dealer\
The server then prompts the dealer to shuffle\
The dealer may choose to shuffle the deck however many times, either randomly or algorithmically. The server shuffles the deck appropriately\
The dealer then informs the server the deck is fully shuffled\
The server passes the deck clockwise to be cut.\
That player may cut or call a special deal\
The server then returns the deck to the dealer, who may then deal (Auto-dealing will also be an option)\
During the first game at each table, whoever is dealt the II is povenost\
The server will reveal povenost and ask povenost to choose between prever or team play\
The server will continue counter-clockwise through each player and ask if povenost 'can go' or if that player would like to play prever

The game splits here.

Povinnost (2 teams) play:

    Povinnost then draws 4 cards from the Talon. The 2 players immediately counter-clockwise from and across from povenost may either draw or pass their cards from the talon.
    The final player may refuse or accept a passed card.
    Povinnost and each other player who drew cards must then discard down to twelve cards.
Prever (1v3) play:

    Prever (the player who declared s/he would like to play by him/herself) draws 3 cards from the talon
    Prever may then lay those cards face up (in prever talon) and draw the remaining 3 cards or keep those cards
    If the cards were laid down, prever may return to them and lay the other 3 cards face-up in the prever talon
    Whichever cards were not kept are then discarded in the opposing team's discard pile.
    Prever must then discard down to twelve cards

Povinnost then declares teammates (starting with the XIX in a standard game, no lower than XV allowed. In Prever, all players know their teammates from the beginning)
All player then may declare point cards:

    4: Big ones (10+ taroks)
    2: Little ones (8-9 taroks)
    2: Bida (1-2 taroks)
    4: Uni (0 taroks)
    2: Honery (pronounced pawn-e or ponnie, 4+ 5-point cards)
    4: Rosa-Honery (all 4 kings)
    6: Rosa-Honery+ (all 4 kings plus another 5-point card)  
    2: Trul (Skyz, XXI/Mund, I/Pagat)

If any player believes that his team will win every trick, he may call Valat (which translates to "roll")

Some players now have the opportunity to call Contra (fleck / flek) and/or Pagat (I) on the end
Any player with the I may call I on the end

Povinnost play:

    Any player who does not have the card Povinnost called (typically the XIX; not on Povinnost's team) may call Contra/fleck and double the payout at the end of the round
    Any player on Povinnost's team (Either Povinnost or a player with the card Povinnost called) may then call Rhea-Contra (misspelled) and re-double (now quadruple) the payout at the end of the round
    Any player who does not have the card Povinnost called may call Supra-Contra and again double the payout (now 8x the original)
    No one may double it more than this.
Prever play:

    Any player besides prever may call contra
    Prever may call Rhea-Contra
    Any player besides prever may call Supra-contra

The game begins:\
Povinnost (regardless if a player is playing Prever) begins the game by playing any card\
Gameplay continues clockwise

Following players may play:

    Any card of the same suit as the lead
    If they do not have any cards of that suit: any trump
    If they do nat have any trumps: any card

Whichever player wins the trick then places the 4 cards into his/her discard pile and leads the next trick

The winning card of a trick is:
    The highest trump
    If there is no trump: the highest card of the lead suit

After 12 tricks (each player starts with 12 cards in hand), the points are counted and winners determined

Players on the same team consolidate their discard piles
Points are counted:
    Kings, Skyz, Mund, Pagat:   5 points
    Queens:                     4 points
    Riders:                     3 Points
    Jacks:                      2 Points
    Remaining color and trump:  1 Point

Each deck consists of 106 points
Whichever team has more points wins

1. Count points
2. Determine distance from 53
3. Add 10
4. Divide by 10 and round
5. Add I on the end
6. Multiply by any multipliers (contra / prever going to the bottom and back up)

Alternatively, counting points is very straight-forward if a player called Valat or if a Valat was achieved:

1. 20 points
2. Add 10 if playing prever
3. Double it if valat was called
4. Contra multipliers

2v2:

    Each losing team player pays that amount, each winning team player earns that amount
1v3:

    1 wins: Each losing team player pays that amount, winning team player earns triple
    1 loses: Each winning team player earns that amount, losing team loses triple

Povinnost then becomes the dealer\
The player directly counter-clockwise of Povinnost becomes Povinnost\
The deck is reshuffled and player starts again
