                <h2>Second Hand Low</h2>
                <p>
                    Second hand Low is a term borrowed from the game of Bridge and refers to a player who is uncertain,
                    usually very early in the hand, and often on the first lead of the hand.
                    The uncertain player does not know who their partner is and finds themselves playing immediately after the player to his left leads a trump.
                    He is therefore the second person to play.
                    If it is the first lead of the hand, it is the Povinost player leading the trump.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Uncertain Player does not have the XIX or he would not be an Uncertain player.
                    Playing "Second Hand Low" preserves the Uncertain Players higher trumps and allows his partner an opportunity to take the trick
                    If the 3rd  person playing has the XIX, they will and should play a very high trump regardless of what card the "second hand" plays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More often than not, this will favor the second player, the uncertain player, by preserving a high trump -
                    The Povinost Partner in the 3rd position will play one of their highest trumps regardless of the Second hand Play.
                </p>
                <h2>Second Hand High</h2>
                <p>
                    If your partner on your left (usually the Povinost Player) leads a low Trump- then Second hand High!
                    You Play your highest trump in order to weaken the hands of players 3 and 4.
                    By weakening your own and (and those of players 3 and 4) your partner's hand becomes much stronger.
                    It beneficial to strengthen your partner's hand at the expense of your own hand. 
                    Remember: what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with all 'General Guidelines' in Taroky, there are times and circumstances where it might not work out... but this is a good general rule in the face of uncertainty
