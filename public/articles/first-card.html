                <h2>The First Strategy - Leading the Skyz</h2>
                <p>
                    Leading the Skyz is a strong first move.
                    It tells your opponents (and your partner) "I intend to valat."
                    There are two main reasons you may want to lead the Skyz:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a strong hand and another player called Tarocky</li>
                    <li>You have a strong hand and another player called Bida</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    First, lets look at Tarocky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As povinnost, when another player calls Tarocky, you typically (but by no means always)
                    know who your partner is. This is especially true if you didn't call the XIX.
                    If you have a strong hand (Especially if you have all three of Skyz, XXI, and XX), leading the Skyz
                    is a good first step to valat. If you aren't partners with Tarocky, however, it can be risky, especially if your hand isn't very strong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other reason you might want to lead the Skyz is to catch Bida's Pagat.
                    If Bida calls Pane and you don't have the Pagat, leading the Skyz is a good way to catch it.
                    If Bida happens to be on your team, Bida will be able to throw you the I.
                    Otherwise, you may catch the XXI or the I anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When to Play the Skyz First
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Skyz should be played first when you intend to valat.
                    Valat - literally "to roll" in Czech - usually involves rolling your hand onto the table, starting
                    with Skyz, then the XXI, the XX, etc.
                    If you don't have the XXI, the Skyz can also be lead to signal to your parnter "Go ahead and play the XXI."
                    Here's a nasty situation which could arise if you instead lead a low trump:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You lead the II. The player across from you is your partner (Tarocky).
                    The second player plays the XX.
                    Your partner, who has the XXI, doesn't play it because he thinks player 4 may have the Skyz.
                    He plays low, and you lose the valat.
                    Additionally, player 2 will now lead back color (he should lead a king), which you may not be void in.
                </p>

                    Pros and Cons
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pros:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A strong lead which lends itself to valat</li>
                    <li>Effective signal to your partner</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Cons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risky when playing against Tarocky - the very situation in which you most want to use it</li>
                    <li>Risky when you don't have a strong hand</li>
                </ul>

                    Playing Against a Skyz Opening
                </p>

                <p>
                    When povinnost leads a Skyz: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start counting. Every trump is going to matter this game.</li>
                    <li>Watch your kings and queens - they may pull a trick from the jaws of valat later in the game.</li>
                    <li>If Tarocky is partnered with Povinnost, ditch the I. The higher trump you'd have to throw to keep it is worth it.</li>
                    <li>Play your trumps from the bottom up (more advanced players may skip around strategically to make it harder to tell how many they have left).</li>
                    <li>Throw away color you know Tarocky is void in. Even if it's a king.</li>
                    <li>Watch for signs of distress - if either player keeps leading trump after you are your partner are out, their color is weak. Or they have 11+ trump (in which case, there's nothing you can do).</li>
                    <li>Keep an off with your queen. When they lead the king, throw the off. Your queen could save you from the valat.</li>
                    <li>Watch what your partner throws - and keep it yourself, if you have the king or queen. If you alternate colors, you have higher chances of catching an off trick.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Second Strategy - Leading a Low Trump</h2>
                <p>
                    A much more common variation, leading a low trump means "I'm looking for my partner. Please play the XIX, then lead back a trump."
                    There are two main reasons you may want to lead a low trump:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have 7+ Trump</li>
                    <li>Another player has Tarocky</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    First, if you have a strong hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually, leading a trump when no one calls Tarocky (besides you) means "I have a strong hand."
                    So, if you don't have a strong hand- maybe because you don't have kings, or your trump are small, or you aren't void in any suits- don't lead a trump.
                    On the other hand, if your hand <italic>is</italic> strong, leading a low trump is the best way to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you lead a trump, your partner should lead a trump back. 
                    You and your partner can swap trumps back and forth, playing offensively.
                    The other two players will try and catch your tricks and lead back color, playing defensively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leading a low trump is a great move to lead into this kind of game, because the XIX will catch the trick. 
                    Leading a medium trump, like the XI or XII, is usually a waste because the XIX will catch it anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, an opposing player will catch the trick with the XX, XXI, or Skyz. 
                    Typically, they will lead back color (Most likely a king).
                    In this case, you may lose a trick or two (if you aren't void in that suit), but you should be able to get back in the lead and pull trump.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another reason you may lead a low trump is if another player called Tarocky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is slightly riskier, but very common.
                    In this case, leading a trump means "I want to know if you're my partner. If you are, please take control and lead a high trump."
                    The advantage of this approach is informational: you know from very early on whether you are partnered with Tarocky.
                    This is imporant because, if your hand is not strong, you need to play defensively early in the game. 
                    An offensive against Tarocky is doomed from the start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you lead a low trump and another player plays the XIX, the meaning of your play changes.
                    Now, it means "I wish Tarocky were my partner. Since he isn't, please lead back a king. Otherwise, lead back another color."
                    Why a king? Because you, as povinnost, got to discard 4 cards. 
                    Even if Tarocky got to discard a card, you have an easier time being void in more suits (usually at least 2).
                    If Tarocky trumps the King, you can play a higher trump. 
                    Otherwise, you can play a low trump (if you have the I, get it home) and bring the king home to safety.

                    <li>If your hand is weak (5 or fewer small trumps, 4 or fewer trumps) and Tarocky isn't your partner, you wasted both a trump and a color lead</li>
                    <li>If your hand is weak and Tarocky's trumps are small, the other team's defensive plays could defeat you</li>
                    <li>If your hand is strong but your partner is weak, you could force moves (e.g., the I and XXI) that your partner would otherwise like to avoid</li>
