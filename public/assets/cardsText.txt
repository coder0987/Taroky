Reminder card text

The deck is dealt out, 6 cards to the center (the "talon") and 12 to each player
For the first round in each game, the player who is dealt the II begins as Povenost
Any player, starting with Povenost and continuing counter-clockwise, may call Prever in order to play alone against the other 3
If no one does, Povenost draws 4 cards from the talon, then the two players counter-clockwise to povenost each draw 1
Prever, if called, draws 3 cards. Prever may swap to the bottom 3 cards and then may again swap back to the top 3 cards
All players then discard down to 12 cards. Players may not discard Kings or Trump cards. In some cases, only Kings and Trump cards may be left. The player may then discard a 1-point trump, but the player must reveal the card as it is discarded
Povenost then calls the partner, player call point cards, Valat, Pagat, and Contra, and game begins with Povenost leading the first trick
Play continues counter-clockwise, each player following suit if possible, playing a trump if not, or "sluffing" a card if out of both
The winner of each trick then collects the card and leads the next until all 12 tricks have been played
Points are counted (see the other side of this card), Povenost shuffles, and Povenost rotates counter-clockwise
